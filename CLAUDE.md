## 2. Architecture Notes

### Dual Pipeline State

Two pipelines remain mounted:

```text
Legacy (Capstone):          Lab Portal:
/api/upload                 /api/documents/upload/{doc_type}
  → NER saat upload           → NER saat submit final
/api/evaluate               /api/recruiter/evaluate/batch
  → rubric_id based           → division based
```

Legacy endpoints are retained for compatibility but are deprecated through response headers and server warning logs.

### NER Timing

```text
Current Lab flow:
  submit → BackgroundTask(NER) → store anonymized_text
  evaluate → check cached? → skip NER
           → cache miss? → fallback inline NER
           → rubric-augmented LLM scoring
```

The background task receives the `SessionLocal` factory and opens its own database session. It must not reuse the request-scoped `db` session.

### Evaluation Wording

Use **rubric-augmented LLM scoring** for the current implementation. LangChain/ChromaDB dependencies still exist, but the current production path builds rubric context directly from the database and sends it in the prompt; it does not perform live vector retrieval at evaluation time.

### Announcement Flow

```text
POST /api/announcements/bulk
  body: { division, period_id, passed_application_ids: [...] }
  scope: evaluated apps in that division + period
  passed ids → announced_pass
  remaining evaluated scope → announced_fail
  audit_logs action_type="bulk_announcement"
```

Bulk announce is phase-locked to `ANNOUNCEMENT`, except for Super Admin correction/bypass.

## 4. Frontend Routes

| Page | Route | Role | Key Elements |
|---|---|---|---|
| Recruiter Dashboard | `/` | Recruiter / Super Admin | Filter, phase card, evaluation, re-evaluation, bulk publish |
| Rubrics | `/rubrics` | Recruiter / Super Admin | Rubric CRUD |
| Candidate Detail | `/candidates/:id` | Recruiter / Super Admin | Documents, SWOT, scores, override |
| Admin Users | `/admin/users` | Super Admin | User management |
| Recruitment Periods | `/admin/periods` | Super Admin | Period CRUD, threshold, close period |
| Candidate Dashboard | `/dashboard` | Candidate | Status, countdown, journey tracker |
| Candidate Profile | `/profile` | Candidate | Profile + division select |
| Candidate Documents | `/documents` | Candidate | 6-step upload wizard |
| Candidate Review | `/review` | Candidate | Final submit gate |
| Candidate Result | `/result` | Candidate | Pass/fail result |
| Legacy Upload | `/upload` | Candidate | Off-nav Capstone compatibility path |

---

## 5. Environment & Config

Phase 2 does not require additional environment variables beyond the current `.env.example`.

Important production variables:

```env
ENVIRONMENT=production
SECRET_KEY=<strong random value>
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-domain.example
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=<key>
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://screenai:<password>@db:5432/screenai_lab
POSTGRES_USER=screenai
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<same password>
POSTGRES_DB=screenai_lab
VITE_API_BASE_URL=/api
```

`VITE_API_BASE_URL` is build-time. Rebuild the frontend when this value changes.

---

## 6. Deployment Plan — Canonical Path

Canonical deployment is **Docker Compose on a single self-hosted VPS**.

| Service | Platform | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend | Docker container | Built from `frontend/Dockerfile`; nginx serves SPA and proxies `/api/` |
| Backend | Docker container | Built from `backend/Dockerfile`; runs `uvicorn backend.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000` |
| Database | Docker container | `postgres:16-alpine`; reachable internally as `db:5432` |
| TLS | Host OS | Nginx/Caddy outside Docker terminates HTTPS and forwards to frontend `localhost:80` |
| File/model storage | Host-mounted directories/volumes | Persist uploads, data, and HuggingFace model cache |

Topology:

```text
browser HTTPS -> host Nginx/Caddy -> frontend container :80
                                        ├─ React SPA
                                        └─ /api -> backend container :8000 -> db container :5432
```

Use [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) as the deployment guide.

Manual `uvicorn` via systemd/supervisor is no longer the recommended production path. It may still be used for local experiments or emergency fallback, but all production documentation should point to Docker Compose first.

## 7. Risk & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| BackgroundTask gagal | anonymized_text null | Evaluation fallback ke inline NER |
| NER model download lambat | First evaluation slower | Mount/cache `./models`, monitor backend logs |
| Period active race condition | Dua period aktif | App-level deactivation + PostgreSQL partial unique index |
| Bulk announce partial failure | Inconsistent announcements | Single DB transaction |
| Candidate submit near phase boundary | NER belum selesai saat eval | Cache check + inline fallback |
| Threshold berubah setelah announce | Highlight changes after decision | Threshold visual only, does not alter announced status |
| Frontend uses wrong API URL | Browser calls dev URL | Set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` before build; rebuild frontend |
| Production secret placeholder | Insecure JWT | Startup guard refuses non-dev boot |
| Missing CORS origins | Browser blocked / unsafe config | Startup guard requires `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in non-dev |

---

## 8. Backlog

| Item | Notes |
|---|---|
| Production cutover | Deploy to actual lab VPS and verify domain/TLS |
| HttpOnly cookie auth | Replace localStorage token storage + add CSRF protection |
| OCR for image/scan documents | Tesseract/pytesseract or alternative OCR pipeline |
| Email/WhatsApp notification | Notify candidates when results are published |
| Formal XAI module | `xai.py` is still a stub; current explanation comes from `DimensionScore.justification` |
| Non-EPrT certificate support | TOEFL ITP, IELTS, ECCT |
| Analytics dashboard | Aggregate stats per division/period |
| Frontend code splitting | React.lazy for large bundle reduction |
| Horizontal scaling | Redis/shared storage if multi-instance becomes necessary |
| Remove legacy endpoints | After Lab pipeline is stable and no legacy clients remain |

<!-- code-review-graph MCP tools -->
## MCP Tools: code-review-graph

**IMPORTANT: This project has a knowledge graph. ALWAYS use the
code-review-graph MCP tools BEFORE using Grep/Glob/Read to explore
the codebase.** The graph is faster, cheaper (fewer tokens), and gives
you structural context (callers, dependents, test coverage) that file
scanning cannot.

### When to use graph tools FIRST

- **Exploring code**: `semantic_search_nodes` or `query_graph` instead of Grep
- **Understanding impact**: `get_impact_radius` instead of manually tracing imports
- **Code review**: `detect_changes` + `get_review_context` instead of reading entire files
- **Finding relationships**: `query_graph` with callers_of/callees_of/imports_of/tests_for
- **Architecture questions**: `get_architecture_overview` + `list_communities`

Fall back to Grep/Glob/Read **only** when the graph doesn't cover what you need.

### Key Tools

| Tool | Use when |
|------|----------|
| `detect_changes` | Reviewing code changes — gives risk-scored analysis |
| `get_review_context` | Need source snippets for review — token-efficient |
| `get_impact_radius` | Understanding blast radius of a change |
| `get_affected_flows` | Finding which execution paths are impacted |
| `query_graph` | Tracing callers, callees, imports, tests, dependencies |
| `semantic_search_nodes` | Finding functions/classes by name or keyword |
| `get_architecture_overview` | Understanding high-level codebase structure |
| `refactor_tool` | Planning renames, finding dead code |

### Workflow

1. The graph auto-updates on file changes (via hooks).
2. Use `detect_changes` for code review.
3. Use `get_affected_flows` to understand impact.
4. Use `query_graph` pattern="tests_for" to check coverage.
